What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git starts tracking the history of a set of files. You need to do it to create a repository!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area doesn't actually change the working directory or repository. It's useful because
	you can preview changes before you commit, making sure you actually want to make the changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Using the staging area, you can check the files you plan to commit, and make sure what you're 
	commiting makes sense as a logical change. If there are too many or too few files, you can add or
	remove them from the staging area.
