When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when you're collaborating with others, when you want to share your work with the world, when you might 
  want to access the work from another computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You may be making changes in your remote repository that you're not ready to share with the world
	yet. Manually pulling changes allows you better control over what's shared with people other than
	yourself.
